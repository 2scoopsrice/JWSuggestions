A Suggestion Tracker for Johnnywoof Survival

<h3>We are recoding!</h3>
<p>One of the things that's great about Johnnywoof Survival is we make our own core plugin, which we call SurvivalEssentials. It encompasses everything from Towns to Chestshops to our Mineworld. However, there is always room for improvement and that's why I (red_stoner62, Red, Drew, whatever) am recoding the majority of SurvivalEssentials. Mostly because it's messy and makes it hard to add cool new things.</p>

<p>With this new recode comes a chance for you all to help out. I'm aware you all have opinions on <b>everything</b> so I'm hoping some good will come out of this. On this Repository you can leave suggestions for things I should tweak as I recode the systems. I'll do my best to respond to and explain every one of them as best I can and if it's a really awesome idea, then I'll implement it!</p>

<p>To get started head to the issues tab over there (the exclamation mark) ---><br>
<a href = "https://github.com/drewhoener/JWSuggestions/issues">https://github.com/drewhoener/JWSuggestions/issues</a> if you can't see it for whatever reason.
You'll need to create an account to leave comments and suggestions so, if you're not ok with that, then this is not for you.
To create a suggestion, hit the green [New Issue] button.</p>

<p>Give it a title that makes sense, and sums up your issue without being long. Your request should look like this:
<ul>

    <li>Your Minecraft username</li>
    <li>Your Request</li>
    <li>Why you think changing it would make the server better/more enjoyable.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Keep in mind I'm NOT looking for suggestions for new plugins/features right now, mainly interested in making the stuff we have right now as good as it possibly can be. A few additions here and there are nice, but not huge stuff.</p>

<h2>TL;DR I'm recoding all the plugins want to help? Yeah? Cool, go make a request over <a href = "https://github.com/drewhoener/JWSuggestions/issues">here</a></h2>
